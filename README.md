## Introduction

The Satellite Image Classification with TensorFlow project aims to classify satellite images into different predefined classes. The notebook `Satellite-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow_PythonCode.ipynb` demonstrates the entire process of building, training, and evaluating a deep learning model for satellite image classification using TensorFlow.

The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically a modified version of the VGGNet, to extract meaningful features from the satellite images. Transfer learning is employed by utilizing pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions and explanations for each stage of the process, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced practitioners.

## Dataset

The notebook utilizes a publicly available satellite image dataset, which should be downloaded and preprocessed before running the code. The dataset consists of labeled images representing different classes, such as buildings, vegetation, water bodies, and more. The notebook includes instructions on how to acquire and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for model training.
